# Thermochemistry

Simple code to reproduce thermochemistry results from Gaussian 09 for CO2 with B3LYP/6-31G(d).
Gaussian does not print hessian matrix in output, but it can be extracted from formatted checkpoint  ("Cartesian Force Constants").
The thermochemistry implementation is based on the equations from "G98thermo.pdf"  document.

 Needed info:
    coordinates   :    for rotational contribution (inertia moments)
    Hessian       :    for vibrational contribution
    symmetry      :    "sigma" Rotational symmetry number  
    E_electronic  :     DFT energy for electronic contribution
